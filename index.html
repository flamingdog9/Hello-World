 <h1>I Need Your Help</h1>
 <h2>I am learning how to use neural networks and I'm having fun but I realize that I need data for my network so I can train him up to be as smart and as accurate as he can</h2>
 <h3>In the future I'm gonna need some data wether they be pictures of random objects (Ex. cup, phone or hand written numbers I'll specify when I decide)</h3>
 <h2>All you need to do is</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>A clear image of the desired topic (which I'll update on later)</li> 
  <li>Email it to <b>project.data404@gmail.com</b> that's me!
  <li>Make sure to correctly identify the image, (ex. if i ask for kitchen appliances and you take a picture of an oven make sure that the word oven is either in the subject or at least somewhere in the email sent to me</li>
  <li>Thank you so much:)</li>
